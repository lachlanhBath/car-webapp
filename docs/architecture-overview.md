# Car Listing Application Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture for our car listing application built during the 24-hour hackathon. The application scrapes car listing websites, enriches the data with vehicle details and MOT history, and presents it in a modern web interface.

## System Components

![Architecture Diagram](architecture-diagram.png)

Our application consists of the following key components:

1. **Data Collection Layer**
   - Web scrapers for car listing sites
   - External API clients for vehicle data enrichment
   - MOT history data integration

2. **Backend Layer**
   - Rails API server
   - PostgreSQL database
   - Redis for caching
   - Sidekiq for background job processing

3. **Frontend Layer**
   - React single-page application
   - Modern UI components
   - Client-side state management

## Data Flow

1. Scrapers collect raw car listing data in the background via Sidekiq jobs
2. Data is enriched with vehicle details and MOT history
3. Processed data is stored in PostgreSQL
4. Frontend queries the Rails API
5. UI presents data in a responsive, user-friendly interface

## Key Design Decisions

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between frontend and backend
- **Background Processing**: Resource-intensive tasks run asynchronously
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis caching to optimize performance
- **API Design**: RESTful API with JSON responses
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach for all UI components

## Deployment Architecture

The application is designed for quick deployment with:

- Backend services containerized with Docker
- Frontend deployed as static assets
- Infrastructure as code for reproducibility

## Performance Considerations

- Database indexing for fast queries
- Pagination for large result sets
- Image optimization for faster loading
- API response caching with Redis
- Background job prioritization
