# AutoTrader Scraper Enhancement PR

## Overview

This PR enhances the AutoTrader scraper functionality with improved URL extraction, content parsing, and error handling. These changes enable the scraper to find and process multiple car listings per page and handle headless browser scraping more effectively.

## Key Changes

### Scraping Engine Improvements
- Enhanced the headless browser scraper to properly find and extract all car listings from search pages
- Added support for multiple user agents and retry logic to bypass anti-bot measures
- Implemented more robust parsing of listing data using specified selectors:
  - `data-testid="advert-price"` for price extraction
  - `class="*atds-image*"` for image URL extraction
  - `data-gui="advert-description-title"` for description extraction
  - `data-testid="ola-trader-seller-listing"` for finding listings on search pages

### Architecture Updates
- Added a new `scrape_listings` method to handle batch processing of multiple listings
- Improved the `scrape_single_listing` method to provide consistent return values
- Added fallback mechanisms when primary selectors don't match elements
- Fixed constructor initialization to properly handle logger parameters

### Error Handling
- Added comprehensive error catching and logging
- Implemented graceful fallbacks when Chrome is not available in headless mode
- Added diagnostic tools for Chrome installation in WSL environments

### Code Quality
- Standardized method signatures and return values
- Added debug output for easier troubleshooting
- Improved code maintainability with clear method responsibilities

## Testing

The updated scraper has been tested with:
- Single listing page scraping
- Multi-page search results scraping
- Various debug options
- Headless and non-headless modes

## Next Steps

Future enhancements could include:
- Additional site-specific selectors for other car listing websites
- More sophisticated bot detection avoidance
- Integration with a proxy service for IP rotation
- Performance optimization for larger scraping jobs
