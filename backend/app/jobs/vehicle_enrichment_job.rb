    # In a real implementation, this would:
    # 1. Find listings with no vehicle data or incomplete data
    # 2. For each listing, attempt to extract or enhance vehicle data
    # 3. Save the enriched data to the Vehicle model
    # 4. Trigger the MOT history job for vehicles with registration numbers
    
    # Example code (commented out for now)
    # Listing.where(vehicle: nil).find_each do |listing|
    #   vehicle_data = VehicleDataService.extract_from_listing(listing)
    #   vehicle = listing.create_vehicle(vehicle_data)
    #   
    #   if vehicle.persisted? && vehicle.registration.present?
    #     MotHistoryJob.perform_later(vehicle.id)
    #   end
    # end
    
    # For demo purposes, we'll just trigger the MOT history job
    MotHistoryJob.perform_later
